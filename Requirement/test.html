  <h3 align="center" >What is COVID-2019</h3>
  <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

  <p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.</p>
  <p>However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p> 
  <p>Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>
  <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads.</p> 
  <p>Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently.</p>
  <p>Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</p>
  <p>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.</p>
  <p>These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>

  <h3 align="center">Vaccinated of COVID-2019</h3>
  
  <h4>Oxford–AstraZeneca</h4>
  <p>The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, sold under the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, is a viral vector vaccine produced by the British University of Oxford, British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.</p>
  <p>Denmark and Norway suspended the use of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine due to a small number of reports of a rare blood clot disorder.</p> 
  <p>Slovakia suspended its use after the death of a predisposed recipient. South Africa suspended its use because a small trial found only minimal protection against mild to moderate disease from the locally predominant Beta variant.</p> 
  <p>Japan approved the vaccine for emergency use in May 2021, but doesn't plan to use them immediately because of rare cases of a blood clotting disorder reported overseas.</p>
  <p>Later, Japan started to use the vaccine for people aged 40 or over to mitigate the surge of the Delta variant in August.[14]</p>
  
  <h4>Pfizer–BioNTech</h4>
  <p>The Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, also known as Comirnaty, is an mRNA vaccine produced by the German company BioNTech and the American company Pfizer.</p>
  <p>In Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Comirnaty is distributed by Fosun Pharma.</p>
  
  <h4>Janssen</h4>
  <p>The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine[230] is a viral vector vaccine produced by Janssen Pharmaceutica (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>
  <p>It is also known as Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine and as COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.[234] Three countries, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, discontinued the use of the Janssen vaccine in favor of other available vaccines due to a possible link between the vaccine and a rare blood clot disorder.</p> 
  <p>never started deploying the Janssen Vaccine after issues with doses sent from the Emergent BioSolutions manufacturing plant.</p> 
  <p>After 300,000 doses were rejected, no Canadian province has requested the Janssen Vaccine.</p>

  <h4>Moderna</h4>
  <p>The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, also known as Spikevax, is an mRNA vaccine produced by the American company Moderna, the U.S.</p> 
  <p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the U.S.</p> 
  <p>Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.</p>

  <h4>Sinopharm-BBIBP</h4>
  <p>The Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine produced by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and its Beijing Institute of Biological Products.</p>

  <h4>Sputnik V</h4>
  <p>The Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine produced by the Russian Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.</p>

  <h4>CoronaVac</h4>
  <p>The CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine[496] produced by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.</p>

  <h4>Covaxin</h4>
  <p>Covaxin is an inactivated virus vaccine produced by the Indian company Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research–National Institute of Virology.</p>

  <h4>Sputnik Light</h4>
  <p>Sputnik Light is a viral vector vaccine, produced by the Russian Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. It consists of the first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine, which is based on the Ad26 vector.</p>

  <h4>Convidecia</h4>
  <p>Convidecia is a viral vector vaccine produced by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences.</p>

  <h4>Sinopharm-WIBP</h4>
  <p>The Sinopharm WIBP COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine produced by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and its Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.</p>

  <h4>Abdala</h4>
  <p>Abdala is a subunit vaccine developed by the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in Cuba.</p>

  <h4>EpiVacCorona</h4>
  <p>EpiVacCorona is a peptide vaccine produced by the Russian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.</p>

  <h4>Novavax</h4>
  <p>The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed NVX-CoV2373, is a subunit COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Novavax and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI),</p> 
  <p>that is undergoing trials in India under the brand name Covovax. It requires two doses and is stable at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F) refrigerated temperatures.</p>
  <p>NVX-CoV2373 has been described as both a protein subunit vaccine and a Virus-like particle vaccine, though the producers call it a "recombinant nanoparticle vaccine".</p>

  <h3 align="center">Symptoms of COVID-19</h3>
  <h4 align="center">Watch for Symptoms</h4>
  <p>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.</p> 
  <p>Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.</p> 
  <p>Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.</p> 
  <p>People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:</p>
  <p>Fever or chills</p>
  <p>Cough</p>
  <p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
  <p>Fatigue</p>
    <p>Muscle or body aches</p>
    <p>Headache</p>
    <p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
    <p>Sore throat</p>
    <p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
    <p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
    <p>Diarrhea</p>
  <p>This list does not include all possible symptoms.</p> 
  <p>CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.</p>
  <p>Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.</p>
